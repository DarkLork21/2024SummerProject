   <h2>Explanation</h2>
   <p>Ghost pepper is the same as birds eye with one key difference, 
    birds eye will last until enough projectiles hit it to put the fire out whilst ghost pepper last about 3 seconds before going away. 
    That may seem like that alone makes it worse, however on average birds eye will only destroy around 3 tears max while ghost pepper can delete all projectiles until it fissles away, 
    which means when you hit high enough luck it tends to attain much higher value over birds eye </p>
